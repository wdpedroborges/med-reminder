# Med Reminder

This is an app made with React Native and Expo that reminds the person to take their medicine. The app starts with a fixed list of medicines and whenever the user clears the list, the app sends an alert telling him to come back the next day. The app also sends a notification whenever you need to take a specific medicine.
